Follow below steps on docker daemon and client
First, update your existing list of packages:
sudo apt update
Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Add the Docker repository to APT sources:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:
Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:
Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:
apt-cache policy docker-ce
To install docker daemon follow below command on daemon server
 sudo apt install docker-ce
on docker client server execute below command
sudo apt install docker-ce-cli
ondocker daemon
Create the directory to store the configuration file.
#sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
Create a new file to store the daemon options.
#sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/options.conf
Now make it look like this and save the file when you’re done:
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H unix:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
Now, reload the systemd daemon and restart the docker service:

# Reload the systemd daemon.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Restart Docker.
sudo systemctl restart docker
That’s going to let you continue to connect to the Docker daemon from within the VM thanks to -H unix://, but it also exposes the Docker Daemon with -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 so that anyone can connect to it over the non-encrypted port.

on docker client server
If you want to set DOCKER_HOST by default so it always connects remotely you can export it in your ~/.bashrc file. Here’s an example of that as a 1 liner:

echo "export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://<daemonip>:2375" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
Testing
curl <docker-host-ip>:2375/v1.38/containers/json
